This folder has codes concerning MHWs detection using two methods
1. Hobday (adopted from Hobday et al 2016)
2. Modification of Hobday method (adopted from Darmaraki et al 2019)

CODE FOR HOBDAY
For MHWs detection: mhw_hobday.py
                    mhw_wo_cat.py is using mhw_hobday.py code as a module to calculate different MHW metrics and save the result in a nc file, which we will be used for
                    plotting and analysis of MHW 


CODE FOR MODIFIED HOBDAY
For MHWs detection: alternew_hobday.py//
                    alternew_hob_after.py is using alternew_hobday.py code as a module to calculate different MHW metrics and save the result in a nc file, later to be 
                    used for MHW analysis
